# GiphyApp
Usage Instructions:
1. Select the requested gif - trending gif of the day / gif by key word
2. Click the 'Get Gifs' button.
2.1 The requested gifs will apear in the right side of the window.
3. The default number of retreived gifs is '25' (hard coded at this point).
3.1 The user may browse the existing gifs by clicking the 'Next'/'Previous' buttons.



Improvements for this code and optional extentions:
1. Build the UI programmatically - enables quick and easy change in the UI.
2. The API supports requests such as retreival of stickers/random gifs/gifs by known id etc.
Apply usage of these functions in the code (requires changes in the UI, adding these functions to the Enum, 
add a dictionary to the cache in order to save the results and an appropriate method in order to retreive this data).
3. Allow the user to set the limit, rating, language etc. properties
 - requiers changes in the UI and setting these variables in the code not as 'const'.
